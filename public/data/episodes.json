    "description": "Japan’s economy is a fascinating story.\n\n\nGood thing school never told us about it, or I might’ve ended up hating it. In this episode, I try to break down Japan's economic journey in my own way, no jargon, no YouTube explainers, just whatever I can make sense of. Not a nerd, just thinking out loud.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This is not educational content. Drop a DM if I've got something completely wrong. Would love to learn :)\n\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/sociallyacceptedpod/",
